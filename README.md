# WholeFoods-Datascraping-Project-Deployment
This data is scraped/cleaned/engineered through Python script automation using selenium and BS4 from WholeFoods' "Featured On Sale Page". This project features EDA, Amazon Prime vs Non-Amazon Prime membership discounts on sale products as well as app deployment to show live insights of a store of the user's choosing. This allows the user to understand the highest discounted items at their own store.

This ![](https://share.streamlit.io/youssefsultan/wholefoods-datascraping-project-deployment/main) is in the works and will be finished soon.
